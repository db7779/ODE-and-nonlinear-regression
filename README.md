## A first order linear differential equation, a generated dataset and nonlinear regression
We will simulate the behavior of a systme with an already known ODE and generate a dataset with the addition noise. How can we approach the resulting dataset in order to model its behavior, if its actual generation mechanism is not known?
We need a combination of geometry and calculus knowledge in order to think of suitable models (brief analysis can be found in the code comments) just by looking at the plots. After choosing the family of models we want to test, we implement least square root algorithm from scipy.optimize in order to fit a nonlinear regression model. Here, we already know a priori the equation form, so we will only try to estimate the parameters of its general form and see how well it performs, but the implementation would be the same with any nonlinear model we would like to try (which would be the case in an actual data problem).
